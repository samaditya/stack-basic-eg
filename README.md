# stack-basic-eg

I've implemented stack in this program for storing names or ID's of a customer which directly gets pushed into the stack and can be used later in the program for giving the customer a loyalty discount. Secondly, modularising has been done for better reusing of tasks/functions. We have also used a flag variable which checks if the customer is eligible for loyalty discount. The prices of items are imaginary.
